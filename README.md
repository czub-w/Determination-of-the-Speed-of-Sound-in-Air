The aim of the project is to record the signal emitted from two loudspeakers placed 1 meter apart, and then, using the autocorrelation function, determine the time it takes for the sound to travel between them. This, in turn, will allow us to calculate the desired value of the speed of sound propagation in air.

Technical information:
First you have to understand how autocoorelation function works on few different signals, to choose the best one for our project: sin, white noise and chirp

After our experiments we chose white noise signal because of the single pick in autocorelation function

We conducted 3 experiments

Our setup wasn't particularly precise and sterile, that's why on our first experiment we got bad results
